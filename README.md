# **Crime in India**


### **Project Summary**

Setting up a Redshift data warehouse about 'Crime in India' on Amazon Cloud. In-order to formulate various economical and financial decision it is important to analyze socio economic and crime related information of particular geographic location. Which provide a 360 degree overview about any particular area. The dataset contains complete information about various aspects of crimes happened in India from 2001. There are many factors that can be analysed from this dataset


The project follows the follow steps:

    Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
    Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
    Step 3: Define the Data Model
    Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
    Step 5: Complete Project Write Up



Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
Scope

Explain what you plan to do in the project in more detail. What data do you use? What is your end solution look like? What tools did you use? etc>
Describe and Gather Data

Describe the data sets you're using. Where did it come from? What type of information is included?




Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
Explore the Data

Identify data quality issues, like missing values, duplicate data, etc.
Cleaning Steps

Document steps necessary to clean the data




Step 3: Define the Data Model
3.1 Conceptual Data Model

Map out the conceptual data model and explain why you chose that model
3.2 Mapping Out Data Pipelines

List the steps necessary to pipeline the data into the chosen data model
Step 4: Run Pipelines to Model the Data
4.1 Create the data model

Build the data pipelines to create the data model.

4.2 Data Quality Checks

Explain the data quality checks you'll perform to ensure the pipeline ran as expected. These could include:

    Integrity constraints on the relational database (e.g., unique key, data type, etc.)
    Unit tests for the scripts to ensure they are doing the right thing
    Source/Count checks to ensure completeness

Run Quality Checks

4.3 Data dictionary

Create a data dictionary for your data model. For each field, provide a brief description of what the data is and where it came from. You can include the data dictionary in the notebook or in a separate file.
Step 5: Complete Project Write Up

    Clearly state the rationale for the choice of tools and technologies for the project.
    Propose how often the data should be updated and why.
    Write a description of how you would approach the problem differently under the following scenarios:
        The data was increased by 100x.
        The data populates a dashboard that must be updated on a daily basis by 7am every day.
        The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.
